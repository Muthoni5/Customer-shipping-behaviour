# Customer shipping behaviour - Project Overview 

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using transactional data sourced from Excel and modeled for analysis using SQL and DAX.
The dataset contains 3,900 records, capturing customer demographics, purchasing patterns, product attributes, payment behavior, and engagement indicators such as subscription status and purchase frequency.
The goal of this analysis is not only to demonstrate technical competency in data modeling, SQL querying, and DAX measure creation, but also to present business-driven insights that would be valuable to management, operations teams, and hiring decision-makers.
Rather than creating disconnected visuals, the analysis is structured around business questions, ensuring every visual contributes to a coherent narrative and supports data-driven decision-making.

# Data Description
- The dataset includes the following key dimensions:
- Customer Information: Age, Gender, Location
- Product Details: Item Purchased, Category, Size, Color, Season
- Financial Metrics: Purchase Amount (USD), Discounts, Promo Code Usage
- Behavioral Indicators: Subscription Status, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases
- Operational Factors: Shipping Type, Payment Method
- Customer Feedback: Review Rating
All data was imported from Excel, cleaned, and prepared for analysis before being modeled for reporting.

# Analytical Scopes
The analysis is organized into three core scopes to reflect how organizations typically evaluate performance:
1. Revenue & Strategy
2. Operational Performance
3. People & Customer Analytics
Each scope addresses a specific set of business questions and is supported by targeted visuals and measures.

# Scope 1: Revenue & Strategy

The Revenue & Strategy scope focuses on understanding what drives revenue, where value is being generated, and which strategic levers management can optimize to improve financial performance.
The visuals in this section are designed to support:
1.Strategic planning
2.Pricing and promotion decisions
3.Customer segmentation and retention strategies
All insights presented here are derived using a combination of SQL for data exploration and DAX measures for dynamic calculations, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and analytical depth.
