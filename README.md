# Customer shipping behaviour - Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using transactional data sourced from Excel and modeled for analysis using SQL and DAX.
The dataset contains 3,900 records, capturing customer demographics, purchasing patterns, product attributes, payment behavior, and engagement indicators such as subscription status and purchase frequency.
The goal of this analysis is not only to demonstrate technical competency in data modeling, SQL querying, and DAX measure creation, but also to present business-driven insights that would be valuable to management, operations teams, and hiring decision-makers.
Rather than creating disconnected visuals, the analysis is structured around business questions, ensuring every visual contributes to a coherent narrative and supports data-driven decision-making.

#Data Description

-Customer Information: Age, Gender, Location
-Product Details: Item Purchased, Category, Size, Color, Season
-Financial Metrics: Purchase Amount (USD), Discounts, Promo Code Usage
-Behavioral Indicators: Subscription Status, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases
-Operational Factors: Shipping Type, Payment Method

All data was imported from Excel, cleaned, and prepared for analysis before being modeled for reporting.
